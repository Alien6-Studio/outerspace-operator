    Inspired by Isaac Asimov's "Pebble in the Sky", the PeebleSky release represents a significant leap forward in our journey. Just as a small pebble can make ripples in a vast sky, this update introduces powerful features that can make a big impact on your business.

### Leveraging Google Cloud Platform

As a proud member of the __Google For Startups Program__, we've reimagined OuterSpace Operator to fully leverage Google's PaaS services. This strategic decision enhances our offering, making it more powerful, secure, and user-friendly than ever before. We now support a comprehensive range of services including:

* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with Managed Prometheus, available in Autopilot mode
* Google Pub/Sub as a robust replacement for RabbitMQ
* Google Cloud Storage for reliable and scalable data storage
* Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) for efficient database management
* Google Cloud Armor for top-tier security

## Why is this important for your business?

As an Insider, you'll be the first to access these cutting-edge features. This unique opportunity enables you to accelerate the deployment of your algorithms on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), optimize your operations, and gain a competitive edge in your industry. Furthermore, by utilizing managed services, you can significantly reduce your operational costs and focus on what truly matters - growing your business.
