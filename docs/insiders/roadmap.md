# Roadmap

## PeebleSky

!!! example "Planned Release Date: 2023-07-31"
    Inspired by Isaac Asimov's "Pebble in the Sky", the PeebleSky release represents a significant leap forward in our journey. Just as a small pebble can make ripples in a vast sky, this update introduces powerful features that can make a big impact on your business.

Culminating six months of dedicated development and tests, the cornerstone of the PeebleSky release is the transition of our solution to Google Cloud Platform (GCP), unlocking a galaxy of new opportunities. We're excited to announce that this significant update will officially launch on July 31st.

### Leveraging Google Cloud Platform

As a proud member of the __Google For Startups Program__, we've reimagined OuterSpace Operator to fully leverage Google's PaaS services. This strategic transformation enhances our offering, making it more powerful, secure, and user-friendly than ever before. We now support a comprehensive range of services including:

* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with Managed Prometheus, available in Autopilot mode
* Google Pub/Sub as a robust replacement for RabbitMQ
* Google Cloud Storage for reliable and scalable data storage
* Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) for efficient database management
* Google Cloud Armor for top-tier security

#### Why is this important for your business?

As an Insider, you'll be the first to access these cutting-edge features. This unique opportunity enables you to accelerate the deployment of your algorithms on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), optimize your operations, and gain a competitive edge in your industry. Furthermore, by utilizing managed services, you can significantly reduce your operational costs and focus on what truly matters - growing your business.
