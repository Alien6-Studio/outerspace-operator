# Enterprise Support

At Alien6, we understand that our enterprise customers have unique and specific needs. That's why we've developed a three-tier enterprise support program to meet these needs.

* __Community Level__: This level of support is free and accessible to all users. It includes access to our community forum on GitHub where users can ask questions and share solutions. We also provide comprehensive online documentation to help users understand how to use OuterSpace Operator.

* __Standard Level__: This level of support offers access to our Discord server, where users can get technical support during business hours. Customers also have access to priority product updates and regular online training sessions.

* __Premium Level__: This level of support offers a dedicated account manager for each customer, who is their primary point of contact for all support questions. Customers also have access to a private channel on our Discord server for 24/7 technical support, in-person training sessions (if possible), and regular product audits to ensure they are getting the most out of their purchase.
For more information about our enterprise support program, or to subscribe to one of these support levels, please contact us at support@outerspace.sh.
